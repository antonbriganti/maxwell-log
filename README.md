# maxwell-log 
an in-character journal/blog. less of a code thing, more of a creative writing thing. 

## what's the deal here?
### who's Maxwell? 
Maxwell's a character I'm playing in the [Lancer TTRPG](https://massif-press.itch.io) campaign I'm part of.

### what is this? 
I've decided to maintain a basic journal for Maxwell to cover his musings and thoughts on the campaign as we play it. It's a fun way to roleplay and I also just don't really do any creative writing so it's a good excuse to stretch those muscles a bit. 

## tech stack 
### website
this is built to be as lightweight as possible, so I've just stuck to markdown for the writing rendered to just HTML+CSS.

I've used the following things:
- [pico css](https://picocss.com) for style base etc.
- [not-hugo, an anton creation](https://github.com/antonbriganti/not-hugo) for rendering html

### deploy 
currently hosted on my home server and shared with friends
