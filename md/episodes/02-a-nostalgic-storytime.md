title: A Nostalgic Storytime
---

Maxwell found himself lost in thought while he waited for the Castirian engineers who were working on his new mech. He wasn’t sure if he was nostalgic after meeting Ryker’s family, but he found himself recollecting an old memory. Maybe it was his earliest? The more time that passes, the fuzzier the order of it all gets. A young Maxwell was being read a story by his mother. It was his favourite, a tale about a gnome named Jenny Tumbleweed. 

Jenny Tumbleweed was always curious and had to know the answers to every question she thought of. Her tenacity for knowledge helped her solve any problem that she faced, like making sure she didn’t get bitten by venomous snakes or how to scare away bears. 

“You’re a lot like Jenny, Maxwell”, his mother had told him. “You’re always so curious. It’s your greatest strength. You should never forget that. Many people won’t always understand that, and maybe they won’t even like you for being who you are. But you should never let that curiosity get away from you.”

As a young boy, Maxwell didn’t really understand what his mum had meant. Why would people not like curiosity? Having an open mind is healthy, isn’t it? Jenny was always able to save the day thanks to her knowledge! As he grew up though, he realised exactly what she was trying to tell him.

While he grew into a teen, and later, a young adult, it wasn’t always easy being the way he was. But Maxwell had held the stories of Jenny Tumbleweed close during some of the harder moments. Maybe that’s why he wanted to document the world’s beliefs and create a new one? Maybe he wanted to save the day and help someone, just like that little gnome did. 

Maxwell’s thoughts were interrupted by a shout. One of the engineers wanted to know what colours he wanted on the mech. Maxwell shook his head as if to clear his mind and walked over, hoping he could find the right words to describe the shade of blue he was thinking of.
