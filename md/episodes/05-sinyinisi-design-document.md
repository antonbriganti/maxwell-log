title: συγκίνηση / sinyinisi Design Document

```
The following is an attempt to capture the weapon request proposed by Lt. Maxwell to the Unit 02 Engineering Team.   
We were able to create the weapon but it has not seen combat usage yet. 
This document should be updated if any additional changes are made to the weapon in the future. 
```

### Weapon Form  
Just like all weapons wielded by Lt. Maxwell in combat, this weapon needs to be a sword compatible to fit on a Main mount. Although the Lieutenant is returning to a GMS Everest frame which does feature a Heavy mount, we don’t want to have to rework this thing if he pivots to one that doesn’t, like the SSC Mourning Cloak.   
  
### Functionality  
This is where things get complicated. Lt. Maxwell has proposed that this weapon somehow utilise the emotional input from the user. This is because, to quote him directly, “emotion is evolution of instinct, which means I can also evolve my fighting styles.”   
  
To be frank, we were at a loss at how this could possibly be achieved until he returned the next day to tell us that the SSC Atlas and its Terashima Blade would be the key to solving the problem. After working with Lt. Maxwell, we were able to understand what “base emotions” he wanted to represent in combat and began programming them into the Terashima Blade’s stance subroutines.   
  
  
The following are the stances programmed into συγκίνηση / sinyinisi.   
  

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><b>Form</b></th>
      <th><b>Description</b></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><i>Thymos </br>/ Anger</i></td>
      <td>Sword grows in size, and the frame starts to drag it by its side, although it compensates to ensure it actually doesn't touch ground and cause damage to the weapon. All movement becomes more bestial, like a raging bear.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><i>Fovos </br>/ Fear</i></td>
      <td>Sparks start gather around the sword and frame. The frame emits a small static sound on close range frequencies. Movement is very jittery and unpredictable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><i>Filotimo </br>/ Pride</i></td>
      <td>The frame starts to resemble a classic fairy tale knight. When not moving, the sword is held up in front of the frame, giving the impression that it is ready for any form of combat.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><i>Chara </br>/ Joy</i></td>
      <td>The frame's movement and actions are loose and free, almost like it's floating on the wind. When the sword is swung, it uses small propulsion jets to increase the swing speed and velocity. These also allow for quick but limited manoeuvring during the attack.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
  
  
### Widespread Suitability and Reusability  
To be honest, this doesn’t seem like it could work for anyone but Lt. Maxwell. He’s the only one ~strange~ unique enough to want a weapon like this. We’ll keep the blueprints for this in storage but we would recommend that other pilots stick with the SSC Atlas’ Terashima Blade should they want to use this in the future.   
  
  
### Additional Notes  
We’re glad Old Man Ludwig was on secondment with us. He had the idea to tie the stances to the frame’s gait and posture to provide a more dramatic physical representation of the emotions. Ludwig told us that he’d done similar tricks years back, and that it must be a Unit 02 special to want such unique changes.
