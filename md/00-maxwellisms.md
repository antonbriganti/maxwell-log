_In order to aid my responsibilities with summarising Lt. Maxwell's reports, I have decided to keep a reference document of any acronoyms and/or pseudonyms that he includes in his work. I have decided to refer to these as Maxronyms and Maxeudonyms to highlight that these are non-standard military parlance. - Junior Officer Rocia Monero_

### Maxeudonyms
