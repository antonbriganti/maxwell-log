title: Maxwell's Questions
---

### Mission 1
#### Interlude 1
- Maybe it’s a reminder to journal more?
- What’s the military term for team? Squad?

#### Session 1
- Oh god is it in poor taste to use that euphemism about him? 
- Why do these restrictions exist? 
- What happens to Mercury outside the mech?
- Hell, what happens to the Captain inside?
- Is this some kind of psychological protection to prevent from being scarred from combat?
- Is that why they prefer technical weaponry?
- And the last question from this little encounter, what the hell is that politician saying?
- Is this a Castirian mantra?

#### Session 2
- Maybe it’s harder to re-associate than de-associate?
- Is “recalling how was once thought” talking about how this is some kind of ‘reawakened’ religion? 
- Is the R.O. something that was previously worshipped and now it’s been uncovered again?
- Who are the “lost minds”?

#### Session 3
- Does he perceive the gap as a blink?
- Does this mean that the waves are a compartmentalisation of Mercury’s own creation?
- Is Mercury aware of social constructs like gender and race, or does he not have any reason to try and identify or differentiate things unimportant to the battlefield?
- The leader identified themselves as a Bishop, I wonder how high of a rank that is
- To what extent does Mercury view themself as the robot? 
- Do they somehow only see through the sensors? 
- Is dissociation actually about separating the Captain’s brain from his body so that it’s an unconscious conduit between the being known as Mercury and the controls of the mech?
- Does that mean Mercury will never truly _feel_ the sun on his face or the texture of paper?
- Isn’t flesh and skin the same thing, or is there some hidden meaning to differentiate the two?
- Does he understand the irony of a man in the darkness saying that?

#### Interlude 2
- It’s a bit much isn’t it? 
- Did something go really right or really wrong during the 4YAPI?
- Is that why the Director thought there was a connection between the two incidents? 
- Does the Castirian government place a high level of confidence in the soul weighing by the Quartic church?
- What is going on here?
- I don’t think the Captain is lying to us, so does that mean he was betrayed by his own Unit?
- I never really thought I could trust the military completely, but how far does the corruption rot?
