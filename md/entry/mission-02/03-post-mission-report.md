_As before, this is a summary of Lieutenant Maxwell F Olvani’s mission notes. Should further detail be needed, the original notes can be viewed upon request. Additional notes/insights written by author (Junior Officer Rocia Monero) will be marked by “A/N”._

<hr>

#### Toskr Space Station 

- Lt. Maxwell seemed to have some reservations about Lt. Ryker’s change in weaponry, citing concerns that the latter’s performance in previous combat scenarios was exemplary and changing effective strategies posed a significant risk. 
- Lt. Maxwell highlighted Lt. Vuelo and Mercury as being key to the success in defending the orbital cannon.
- There were concerns about the suicidal strategies used by the enemy and how the unit may have been complicit in the deaths of the unknown force (later assumed to be Comedia), but also an acknowledgment that it was beyond the control of Unit 02 and that protecting the station was the highest priority. 
- A significant amount of risks were taken and resources were invested in safeguarding Toskr Station.

#### Mines Checkpoint

- Lt. Maxwell highlighted Lt. Vuelo’s work in the battlefield, having taken the majority of the hits for the unit at great risk to himself while still trying to rally everyone else to take the point. 
- He attempted the use of technical attacks during the combat but seemed to not understand how to utilise Ithiki’s hacking capabilities. 
- The use of exposed nuclear cores from the mercenary forces resulted in casualties due to combat triggering a nuclear explosion. Lt. Maxwell expressed concerns that this could have been avoided with more careful planning. 
- Lt. Ryker was physically hurt through unclear circumstances. (**A/N:** _Looking through combat logs and reading between the lines in Lt. Maxwell’s report, it seems Lt. Ryker struggled during this encounter. Maybe the change in weaponry was a significant factor behind this. I would recommend that engineers review all Unit 02 equipment and ensure that they are calibrated correctly._)
- There was a mention of a bounty placed on Unit 02, and Lt. Maxwell discussed in great length the ethical implications of collecting it for himself and waiting for Castirian forces to rescue him. (**A/N**: _It is unclear what strategic value this operation would have._)
- Lt. Maxwell noted that Captain was not able to re-associate without manual intervention. He said if this was an intentional change, it should have been communicated to the team before mission start in light of the Safsarat Base Mercury incident.

#### Union Town & Paracausal Encounter

- Lt. Maxwell passionately outlined further frustrations about Captain’s presence, or lack thereof, during the mission. The lieutenant also took issue with what he perceived as Capt. Hermes’ flippant attitude about the combat experiences and laconic replies. 
- The following is a verbatim statement from Lt. Maxwell’s report: “True evil is born from man, and it lived in that union town. It was not paracausal but managerial in nature.”  He went on to explain that the union members were peaceful and did not attack, nor did they seem to support the violent means used by the mercenaries. 
- Lt. Maxwell has deemed that there does not seem to be an explicit religious relationship between the ~~Red Object~~ HUP2 and the people who have encountered it, but instead seems to be an effect similar to hypnotic suggestion. 
- As with all casualties on this mission, Lt. Maxwell regrets that the combat resulted in deaths. 
- Lt. Maxwell recommends that Unit 02 spends time with Mercury outside of combat to discuss things without risk of combat breaking out.

**A/N**: _Despite Lt. Maxwell’s insistence that his battle skillset is average, during this mission he showed a significant understanding of combat tactics. For example, in response to Emissary’s ability to mitigate close range damage, he chose to engage the smaller sized enemy mechs and focused on his positioning to provide cover to his squad mates. Is it a self-esteem issue or does he genuinely not realise his abilities? Perhaps related to this, Lt. Maxwell seems to view the mission as a failure._

_Lt. Maxwell’s report seemed to be more reserved than his one for the initial mines incident. There were fewer musings about what he experienced and more of a focus on the facts of the mission. I am personally happy to see this and hope he continues to learn brevity. I am still unsure of how much of a liability the lieutenant is. His effectiveness in the field speaks for itself, but I am not sure someone who has such a conscience for the dead is well suited for a soldier’s life. Then again, Lancers have always been a strange bunch._
