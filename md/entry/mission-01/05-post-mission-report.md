_The following is an attempt to summarise Lieutenant Maxwell F Olvani’s mission notes. While they do provide great insight into elements not focused on in other reports, the sheer length and format they’re provided in don’t fit up to Castirian military standards. Should further detail be needed, the original notes can be viewed upon request. Additional notes/insights written by author (Junior Officer Rocia Monero) will be marked by “A/N”._

#### Combat Encounter at the Mines 
- The negotiations between the Castirian envoys and the miners’ union deteriorated quickly and escalated into combat. The first shots were fired by the union, not us.
- Unit 02’s skillset is widely varied and expertly performed. Lt. Maxwell does not seem to see the value in his own skills despite the positive response he gets. For some reason, he views his melee prowess as something that anybody could do.
- Lt. Maxwell seems to have great admiration for Lt. Vuelo in particular
- Mercury has a preference for technical weaponry and refers to enemy combatants as ‘waves’ 
- Overall despite the sudden attack, Unit 02 seems to have worked well as a squad and limited practice time together 


#### Ambush in the Valley 
- Lt. Maxwell had especially high praise for his entire unit, in particular highlighting Lt. Ryker’s Cyclone Pulse Rifle usage and Lt. Vuelo’s ability to use their size as cover
- Was equally highly _critical_ of his own performance due to the amount of damage taken and poor combat performance.
- Both audio logs from the mission and his own notes explain his personal belief that the ~~Red Object~~ Unknown Entity might be a source of religious worship for an unclear group of people inclusive of the Miners’ Union


#### Return to Safsarat Base
- Lt. Maxwell expressed minor frustrations with Capt. Hermes not being able to provide tactical guidance on how to approach the Base, but praised Lt. Ryker for their insights when asked
- The Quartic Royal Guard were unaware of what happened at Safsarat Base as well as the existence of the ~~Red Object~~  Unknown Entity. 
- Attempts were made to peacefully resolve the encounter with Quartic Royal Guard but came to an impasse over Unit 02’s commitment to returning to Castiria before anything else happened
- The unit experienced difficulties with Mercury post-combat (**A/N:** _I have been advised that the particulars of what happened are not to be written down as part of this summary, despite the significance placed by Lt. Maxwell in his notes on his interpretation of it._)

**A/N:** _Lt. Maxwell seems to have a light distrust of the government. It’s unclear if this will affect his mission performance, as despite his apparent empathy for the Miners’ Union, he was still willing to engage them in combat. His reasons to fight for us are not driven by patriotism or chances to improve his piloting skills, but instead seem to be almost academic in nature. Fitting for someone with the callsign Philosopher, but I’m not sure it’s something we can rely on long term._

_Still, having someone who is constantly critically thinking about things from an non-Castirian (and honestly non-military) perspective feels like it has a high amount of value for these post mission reports._

_One final note: it is unclear if Lt. Maxwell knows the names of anybody on his unit. Or this summary I have made sure to use their names and ranks, but the lieutenant seems to just refer to them by descriptors (e.g. Dog Man, Mechanic)._
